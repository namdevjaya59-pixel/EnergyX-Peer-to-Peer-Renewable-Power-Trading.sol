# EnergyX Smart Contract

## Project Title
EnergyX - A Decentralized Energy Tracking Solution

## Project Description
EnergyX is a decentralized application (DApp) built using Solidity and Ethereum, aimed at tracking and managing energy consumption. The smart contract enables users to store, update, and retrieve energy data. It aims to promote transparency, efficiency, and decentralization in the energy industry.

## Project Vision
The vision of EnergyX is to provide an open-source, transparent, and immutable solution for energy tracking. By leveraging blockchain technology, EnergyX will enable individuals, businesses, and organizations to accurately and securely manage their energy data, fostering a more sustainable energy ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Store Energy Data**: Allows users to store energy consumption values on the blockchain.
- **Retrieve Energy Data**: Users can access stored energy values anytime using a simple getter function.
- **Update Energy Data**: The energy value can be updated with a higher value, ensuring data integrity.
- **Transparency**: Since the contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, energy data is public and immutable.
- **Security**: The use of smart contract logic ensures that only valid data (e.g., increased energy values) can be updated.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with IoT Devices**: EnergyX can be integrated with IoT sensors to automatically track and update energy consumption data.
- **Tokenization**: Introduce energy credits as tokens that users can buy, sell, or trade within the platform.
- **Energy Marketplace**: Facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading through smart contracts to promote renewable energy adoption.
- **Decentralized Analytics**: Use blockchain for transparent analytics and reports on energy usage trends.
